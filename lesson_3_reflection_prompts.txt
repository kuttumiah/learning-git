When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    If I would like to share the repo and get contribution from with others

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    If I break something then I could revert that, that's why I want to
    do it manually

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    When I don't have permission to make change ones repository on Gitub at
    that moment I "fork" the repo
    I use clone when I want to make a copy of a repo on local machine from
    one directory to another and when I want to copy a repo from GitHub to
    my local machine then I would also use "clone"
    When in local or remote I want to test with some features then I create
    "branch"
