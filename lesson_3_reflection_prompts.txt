When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    If I would like to share the repo and get contribution from with others

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    If I break something then I could revert that, that's why I want to
    do it manually

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    When I don't have permission to make change ones repository on Gitub at
    that moment I "fork" the repo
    I use clone when I want to make a copy of a repo on local machine from
    one directory to another and when I want to copy a repo from GitHub to
    my local machine then I would also use "clone"
    When in local or remote I want to test with some features then I create
    "branch"

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    It helps to detect the state of local compared to the memote repository
    and also helps to cooperate with others as it is possible to check
    wheather there is any new change to the remote after my previous
    pulling and also get them.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Without Git or GitHub I've to make copy of the working directories and
    track the list of files that changed. And at the end merge them manually
    after checking.
