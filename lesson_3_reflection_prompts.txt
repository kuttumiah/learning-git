When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    If I would like to share the repo and get contribution from with others

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    If I break something then I could revert that, that's why I want to
    do it manually
